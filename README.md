## Quick Start  
We use MongoDB Atlas cloud database, so database setup is unnecessary.
After running the following commands in terminal, the project will be hosted on **http://localhost:3000** in dev mode.  
**Test account: username: roy, password: qqq** 
```shell
# install the dependencies for frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# install the dependencies for backend
cd backend
npm install

# under both '/backend' and '/frontend' to start hosting in dev mode
npm start
```
