## Project features
Paws Home, a web service dedicated to lost pet searching.

**Must-have features:**
- Account Management.
- Home Page. A dashboard shows the general operational data of this website. Newest Posts exhibits the newly added lost and found posts.
- Post Plaza. All posts are displayed here. Users can search by keywords or some criteria.
- My Post. Here, users manage the post related to themselves.
- Matching Engine. This invisible component performs matching upon lost and found posts and produces hooks between them. Thus, users can see ordered matching posts under their posts.
- Witness report. A missing pet witness can contribute a witness report with a coordinate on Google Maps. The Matching Engine will use the reports to depict a trace and refine the matching as per the newly marked spots.

**Should-have features:**

- Heat Map. Users can observe the missing reports near themselves by granting us access to their current location. The heat map shows plots of all posts as marks on Google Maps.

**Could-have features:**

- Nearby vets. When the found pet is injured, handy information about the vets nearby could help them get timely medical aid.
